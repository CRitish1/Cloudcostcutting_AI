# Cloud Cost Comparison Tool

## Overview
The Cloud Cost Comparison Tool is designed to help users compare the cost of cloud services between AWS (Amazon Web Services) and GCP (Google Cloud Platform). This Python script facilitates the collection and analysis of billing data for instances running on these platforms, enabling users to make informed decisions about cost-efficiency and resource management.

## Features
- **Billing Link Access**: Direct links to AWS and GCP billing pages for easy access to your billing information.
- **Data Collection**: Inputs for the number of instances and their respective costs on both AWS and GCP.
- **Cost Analysis**: Compares total costs between AWS and GCP and identifies which is cheaper.
- **Resource Optimization**: Identifies and lists any instances that incur no cost and may be considered unnecessary.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Access to AWS and GCP accounts for billing information.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```
   python cloud_cost_comparison_tool.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input your AWS and GCP instance information.
